# White-Box-Cryptography-Algorithm-Based-on-Neural-Networks
The method consists of an obfuscation technique and a white-box AES encryption process. 

The said obfuscation technique summarizes the core steps of the fixed-key AES scheme into a plurality of mapping tables, which are trained by overfitting the tables to enable neural networks to replace the encryption and decryption operations to achieve the obfuscation effect. The described white-box AES encryption process is divided into two stages, firstly, the round key addition and byte substitution operation of each round of AES is disambiguated with class S-box to protect the key and the combined mapping is obfuscated with neural network; secondly, the corresponding disambiguation recovery operation is introduced in the column obfuscation operation and a randomly generated key byte is dissociated after the multiplication operation and the above operation is substituted with neural network.
